# A Simple Command Prompt
A generic posix command prompt. Use this when you're implementing something in
C++ and you need some kind of command-line interface (e.g., an interactive 
programming language would be an appropriate use-case).

## Features
* A header-only C++ posix implementation of a basic command prompt
* With history and tab completion.
* Just add a callback.
* Very easy to use. See test.cpp.
